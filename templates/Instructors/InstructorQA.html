                    Serious Challenges are typically scheduled graded course exams or quizzes (as included in course syllabus).

                    The process varies, but generally an instructor creates a Model Solution, which sample code in either Java or Python, that will be separated by each line of code for the student to arrange. 
                    The code doesn’t need to be able to run in a compiler. 
                    The instructor can also  decide whether proper indentation would be graded and choose to add distractors, lines of code that incorrectly fit with the code. 
                    One key difference in the typical problem setup is that Difficulty serves a greater purpose. 
                    As Difficulty increases, the more distractors will appear in the problem.

                    Instructors are capable of creating problems that have randomly generated questions, or using external tools, such as compilers and interpreters, to generate questions. 
                    There are two types of dynamic problems: Templates and Raw Lua.
                    A Template problem allows instructors to configure the setup of a problem and then later specify the details of the problem. 
                    A Raw Lua problem is more flexible than Template, but most things can be done with Template problems. 
                    Instructors should use Raw Lua problems if they want specific results from their code.</span>

                    Click Create Problem and select Dynamic (Template).

                    <p style = "text-indent:40px">The four distinct sections require more nuance: Add Dependency, Dependent Libraries, Set-Up Code, and Template. 
                    Instructors can add any Lua Libraries that they have uploaded as dependencies by clicking the Add Dependency drop-down menu and selecting their desired library. 
                    The new dependency will appear in the Dependant Libraries section. 
                    Lua code is used to set up any needed variables and perform any complex should be included in the Set-Up Code section.

                    A piece of code that must be included in the problem is the <b>make_answer</b> function which is used to create answer blanks. 
                    The make_answer function takes five arguments: The name of the answer blank (displayed to students when describing their results), 
                    the type of answer blank, the size, the answer checking function to be used (several of which are provided), and the maximum amount of points the student can receive for the answer blank. A

                    <p style = "text-indent:40px">There are four sections that require attention: Add Dependency, Dependent Libraries, Number of Parts, and Code. 
                    Both Add Dependency and Dependent Libraries function exactly as they do with Templated problems, allowing Instructors to add any Lua libraries they have uploaded. 
                    The Number of Parts is a function similar to the Add Part button in Templated problems. 
                    If you wish for a multi-part problem, it must be manually specified by entering the amount of parts in the field. 
                    The Code section is where the problem is made using Lua Code. 
                    The code, when run, should define the following: part_1_text, evaluate_answer_1, and part_1_max_points.  
                    </p>
                    <p style = "text-indent:40px">The <b>part_1_text</b> function takes no input and produces a string which represents the HTML for the first problem. 
                    If you have more than one part to this problem, you should also define similar functions call part_2_text, part_3_text, etc. 
                    The <b>evaluate_answer_1</b> function takes in a table which maps the names of the form inputs from part 1 to values which are the answers provided for those form inputs by the user. 
                    It returns a table which maps the names of the form inputs to a table containing two values: “success”, which maps to a boolean indicating whether or not the answer was sufficient to continue to the next part and "value", which maps to a floating point number indicating how many points were awarded for that answer. 
                    The <b>part_1_max_points</b> function takes no input, but returns a table which maps the name of each input to the maximum possible number of points a student could earn for that problem. 
                    An example of proper Raw Lua code is in the Code section when creating the problem.

                    <span>Rule Conditions are the backbone of the gamification system of OneUp. 
                    In broad terms, they are the rules that are checked to see if specific conditions are met. 
                    If they are, then an event specified by the Instructor occurs. 
                    These events can vary: A badge is awarded, Virtual Currency is awarded, a new Challenge is unlocked, or some other situation. 
                    While sounding complex and intimidating, creating Rule Conditions can be thought of simply thought of as rules specified as a boolean expression. 
                    An event only fires if the proper conditions are met.</span>

                    <p style = "text-indent:40px">If you’re creating a badge, setting VC earning rules, or configuring Progressive Unlocking, you’ll need to specify the Rule Conditions. 
                    The Rule Conditions section is always found at the bottom of the page. 
                    Rule Conditions work by having a variable of some sort on the left-hand side (i.e Activities Completed, Badges Earned, etc) and having the required condition on the right-hand side. 
                    A full Rule Condition would read like this: Percent of student score for Challenges X,Y,Z is more than or equal to 75. </p>
                    <p style = "text-indent:40px">The Rule Conditions section is a drag-and-drop interface: drag a condition type into the dotted rectangle to begin modifying it. 
                    Note the small <b>AND</b> with another dotted rectangle under it once a rule type is dragged in. 
                    This is for when you want multiple conditions to be true in order for the rule to fire (i.e. x = 2 AND y = 3). 
                    By default, an Atom condition type is the first condition.  
                    There are three condition types: <b>Atom, OR,</b> and <b>Forall.</b> </p>
                    <p style = "text-indent:40px">The <b>Atom</b> condition is a single conditional statement (i.e. if (x = 5) would only be true if x = 5). 
                    Atom is the primary condition type, for they can apply to most situations.
                     By default, an Atom condition type is the first condition in the Rule Conditions section. 
                     The Atom condition has three parameters: the variable, the operator, and the threshold. 
                     The variable is the specific condition that is being checked (i.e. student percentage score on a challenge). 
                     The operator parameter has five options: greater than (>), less than (<), equal to (=), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=). 
                     The operators functions just as they do mathematically. 
                     The Threshold option simply specifies the value required for the condition to trigger. 
                     By default, the Threshold is a number value, but if the Value checkbox is unchecked the Instructor can choose another variable to compare to the first. </p>
                    <p style = "text-indent:40px">The <b>OR</b> condition specifies that one of two or more conditions can be true and the entire condition would be true (i.e. the statement if (x < 2) OR (x > 4) would be true if x = 1 or 5). 
                    OR is useful if the Instructor desires multiple ways to satisfy a condition. </p>
                    <p style = "text-indent:40px">The <b>Forall</b> condition allows Instructors to specify how broad the rule is. 
                    There are three selectors in Forall: For, of the following, and items to add. 
                    The For selector simply specifies whether each or all of the specified assignments will be considered. 
                    The Of the following selector allows the Instructor to select from challenges, activities, topics, and categories. 
                    The Items to add selector allows the Instructor to add one or more of the items specified in the Of the following selector. 
                    The checkbox next to the Items to add selector will select all of the items available if checked (i.e All Activities). 
                    At the bottom of the Forall condition is another dotted rectangle. 
                    The Atom or OR condition dragged there will work just the same, but with the added restrictions set by the Instructor. 
                    Once an Atom condition is placed, the available variables become more specific depending on the item type selected in the Of the following selector. 
                    To remove a condition from the area, drag it to the <b>Trash</b> box at the upper left of the section.</p>

                    <span>Badges are a form of an award a student can recieve for completing tasks specified by the Instructor. 
                    There are three types of Badges: Automatic, Manual, and Time-Period based. 
                    Automatic Badges are awarded according to Rule Conditions defined by the Instructor.
                     Manual Badges are badges with no conditions that are assigned to individual students. 
                     Time-Period Based Badges are awarded at specific time intervals to a limited number of students who meet certain conditions (i.e. students with a 5-day attendance streak). 
                     The main purpose of Badges is to give students a sense of achievement and progress as they advance through the course. 
                     Badges that students earn are shown in their Achievements page and the Latest Badges section of the Course Home page.</span>

                    The same badge image can be used for multiple badges. 
                    The Award Frequency option specifies whether to award the badge just once, or once per Challenge, Activity, Topic, or Category. 
                    To define Rule Conditions for the Badge, follow the guidelines discussed in How do I create a Rule.

                    These are not unlike Rule Conditions, but much more streamlined to simplify the process. 
                    There are four condition options that require attention: Give To, Number of Students, Time Period, and the Condition section. 
                    The Give To option allows Instructors to give the badge to either a top number of students (Top #), all students, or randomly. 
                    The Number of Students option sets the amount of students of the class will earn the badge and only appears if the Top # option is selected. 
                    The Time Period drop-down menu specifies how often the badge will be awarded to students (i.e. Daily, Weekly, etc.). 
                    The Condition section functions much like a Rule Condition, but more specific options.

                    Virtual Currency can be spent on useful rewards at the discretion of the Instructor: Deadline Extensions, Assignment Resubmissions, Extra Credit, Lowest Grade replacement, and a great host of other benefits. 
                    As with Badges, there are three different types of Virtual Currency earning rules: Manual, Automatic, and Time-Period Based. 
                    Manual earning rules are rules with no conditions that are assigned to individual students. 
                    Time-Period Based rules are awarded at specific time intervals to a limited number of students who meet certain conditions (i.e. students with a 5-day attendance streak). 
                    The main purpose of Badges is to give students a sense of achievement and progress as they advance through the course.  </span>

                    The primary difference here is the Time-Period conditions. 
                    These are not unlike Rule Conditions, but much more streamlined to simplify the process. 
                    There are four condition options that require attention: Give To, Number of Students, Time Period, and the Condition section. 
                    The Give To option allows Instructors to give the VC to either a top number of students (Top #), all students, or randomly. 
                    The Number of Students option sets the amount of students of the class will earn the VC and only appears if the Top # option is selected. 
                    The Time Period drop-down menu specifies how often the VC will be awarded to students (i.e. Daily, Weekly, etc.). 
                    The Condition section functions much like a Rule Condition, but more specific options. 
                    The Operator and Threshold option functions the same as with Rule Conditions. 
                    Additionally, the Course Bucks Earned with this Rule field is simply the amount of Course Bucks that will be earned by the students once the Time-Period completes a cycle. 
                    Once all parameters are satisfactory, click Create Rule to add the new Time-Period Rule to the Periodic Virtual Currency Rules page.</span>

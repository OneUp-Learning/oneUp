                  <span>In OneUp, course tests and quizzes are 'challenges' and the questions included in them are
                    'problems'.
                    Challenges are divided into two types.
                    Warm-up Challenges are primarily for student practice and do not directly contribute to the course
                    grade.
                    Typically the students can take a warm-up challenge as many times as needed to get a correct answer.
                    The scores of the Warm-Ups are not shown in the Gradebook.
                    By contrast, Serious Challenges are typically scheduled graded course exams or quizzes (as included
                    in course syllabus).
                    The primary idea being that the warm-up challenges should prepare the students for the serious
                    challenges.
                    Both types of challenges are automatically checked and the student is shown a score which reflects
                    their performance.

                      After creating a name for the challenge, there are a plethora of configuration options available
                      to Instructors.
                      The Difficulty option has three options: Easy, Medium, and Hard. While selecting a difficulty is
                      optional, it will categorize the challenges created.
                      The option to Randomize Problems will make problems appear in a random order when taken by
                      students instead of the order that they are added to the challenge. </p>
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">Instructors can set Availability constraints including visibility,
                      attempts, time limit, and password-lock.
                      By default the challenge will be visible to students, but the date range of that visibility and
                      the due date for the challenge can be set.
                      If a challenge is past its due date but still within the visible date range, it will still be
                      available to students.
                      Also by default, the number of attempts and the time limit are unlimited, but can be restricted.
                      It should be noted that the time limit is in minutes, not seconds. </p>
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">Instructors can password lock a challenge.
                      Simply create and confirm a password and distribute it to students as deemed necessary.</p>

                      each student's' score after they take the challenge.
                      The option 'Possible points for a manually graded section of the challenge' allows the instructor
                      to create a serious challenge with two parts:
                      one consisting of OneUp problems which will be automatically scored and another of questions given
                      (e.g. on paper) to the students, which the instructor will grade.
                      After the grading, the instructor has to enter for each student the points scored on the manually
                      graded part in the corresponding field in the Adjustment page.
                      To go to this page, click on Adjustment in the menu besides the corresponding challenge (on the
                      page displaying the list of challenges).</p>
                    <p style="text-indent:40px"> The Topics drop-down menu displays the course topics previously created
                      by the instructor. This option allows connecting the challenge to a particular course topic.
                      If no topic is selected for the challenge, it will default to Unspecified, which will
                      automatically place it in the Miscellaneous section.
                      It is highly recommended that Topics are assigned to the warm-up challenges for ease of
                      findability. </p>
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">Instructors also have the option to attach their own Tags to challenges.
                      Attaching Tags allows challenges to be searched for by those Tags.
                      The Feedback Options let Instructors determine how much feedback students get for each challenge.
                      By default, the Display Correct Answers option is enabled, which shows the students the correct
                      answers after they complete the challenge.

                    The instructor can upload files for the students to complete assignments and students can submit

                      the submission deadline for the activity, respectively.
                      The Activity Category selection option allows assigning the activity a specific category.
                      Activity Categories can be defined by following the steps outlined in What are Activity Categories
                      (under Course Information).
                      If no category is selected, it will default to Uncategorized.
                      The instructor has the option to decide if the Activity is graded and to allow students to upload
                      files.
                      The Activity Graded option simply allows the Activity to be graded by the Instructor. Graded
                      activities are shown in the GradeBook.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">Enabling students to upload files means that instructors will be able to

                      Instructors can also restrict the amount of Upload Attempts, restricting to a certain amount of
                      submission attempts.
                      Instructors can upload their own files for the student to download to complete the Activity.

                      Choice, True/False, Multiple Answers, Matching, Parson's Problems, and Dynamic problems.
                      Problems can be assigned Targeted Skills, Difficulty, and Feedback to students.
                      <p style="text-indent:40px">Problems are designed to be included in Challenges.
                        They can be created either directly in a specific Challenge, or on the Problems page. In the
                        latter case, they are stored in the OneUp Problem Pool (for later use) and are not assigned to
                        any Challenge.
                        The Problems page displays all such 'unassigned' problems.</p>
                      <p style="text-indent:40px">The problems in the Problem Pool are not ready for use just yet.
                        A problem from the pool must be assigned to a Challenge first, then students will be able to
                        access it.
                        Once the problem is assigned, it is removed from the Problem pool and can be accessed via the
                        Challenge.
                        Problems can only be assigned points when they are added to a particular Challenge.
                        If no points are assigned at that stage, the system will give zero points to the student for
                        this problem.</p>
                      <p style="text-indent:40px">When you delete a problem from a Challenge, it is not removed from the

                      The Problem Text contains either the the problem itself or instructions for the problem and is
                      shown to the students.
                      The Difficulty option has three options: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
                      Like with challenges, selecting a difficulty is optional but helps categorize problems.
                      For Parson problems, increasing the difficulty increases the amount of distractors shown to
                      students (see Problems/How to Create a Parson's Problem).

                      The skill points indicate how the problem contributes to increasing the level of student mastery
                      of related skills.
                      Instructors can choose to write feedback for when students answer the problem correctly and
                      incorrectly. They can also write notes for themselves in the Instructor’s Notes.
                      The author of the problem, by default, is the Instructor who creates the problem, but this can be
                      changed if desired. In particular, if the instructor enters somebody else's problem, here they can
                      acknowledge the authorship.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">Tags can be attached to problems.

                    <p style="text-indent:40px">In the Model Solution area the instructor has to enter a correct
                      solution of the problem - the lines and blocks of code which will be given to the student to
                      arrange.
                      To combine two consecutive code lines in a block, which will be dragged by the student as one
                      unit, type ' ##' at the end of the first line.
                      You have to combine in blocks code lines, such as assignment statements and closing brackets
                      ('}'), which can be arranged correctly in different ways.
                      Otherwise the system may mark a correct student solution as wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">In addition to the correct code lines for solving the problem, the
                      instructor may include ‘distractors’. Distractors are code lines which do not belong to the
                      correct solution and should not be dragged to the solution area.
                      A distractor is indicated by typing '#distractor' at the end of the code line, e.g. ' i--;
                      #distractor'.
                      One key difference in the typical problem setup is that Difficulty serves a greater purpose here.
                      The system automatically selects how many of the provided distractors should be shown to the
                      student based on the specified level of problem difficulty.
                      As Difficulty increases, the more distractors will be shown to the students. </p>

                <div class="collapsible-body">
                  <span>Dynamic problems are problems created with Lua code that have far more versatility than static
                    problems.
                    Instructors can create dynamic problems which have random elements to questions. In some cases, they
                    might also create static questions with dynamic grading when there are many different correct
                    answers possible. This includes support for using external tools such as compilers and interpreters
                    as part of the grading process so that you can grade simple programming problems even when there are
                    many possible variations on the solution.
                    There are two types of dynamic problems: Templates and Raw Lua.
                    A Template problem allows instructors to enter the formatted text of a problem and only fill in
                    specific details dynamically using values set up in the code portion.
                    A Raw Lua problem is more flexible than Template, but requires more programming in Lua. Instructors
                    should use Raw Lua problems only if they are trying build a problem where the text or structure is
                    likely to vary radically between the different randomized instances. We expect that this will be
                    quite rare.
                    Most things can be done with Template problems.

                      The first part of the problem setup has standard configuration options of a Problem (Problem

                    <p style="text-indent:40px">The four distinct sections require more nuance: Add Dependency,
                      Dependent Libraries, Set-Up Code, and Template.
                      Instructors can add any Lua Libraries that they have uploaded as dependencies by clicking the Add
                      Dependency drop-down menu and selecting their desired library.
                      The new dependency will appear in the Dependant Libraries section.
                      Lua code is used to set up any needed variables and perform any computations needed including
                      computing the answer that the student answer will be checked against. It should be included in the
                      Set-Up Code section.
                      The problem itself should be below.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">To display a variable in the Problem Area, it must be enclosed in pipes
                      (vertical lines) enclosed in brackets (ex. [|x|]). To include Lua code, it must be enclosed in
                      curly braces enclosed in brackets (ex. [{Some code for your thoughts}]).
                      A piece of code that must be included at least in the problem is the <b>make_answer</b> function
                      which is used to create answer blanks. If this is omitted, students will not be able to answer the
                      generated question. More than one answer blank can be included in a single problem.
                      The make_answer function takes five arguments: The name of the answer blank (displayed to students
                      when describing their results),
                      the type of answer blank, the size, the answer checking function to be used (several of which are
                      provided), and the maximum amount of points the student can receive for the answer blank. A
                      simple example make_answer is provided when creating a Template problem in the Template section.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">Instructors can create multi-part problems, where the next part is
                      dependant on the previous one.
                      Simply click the Add Part button to add an additional Template section.
                      Instructors can also test their problems before creating them in by clicking the Try Out Question
                      button at the bottom of the page.
                      The Random Seed field affects any random variables that the Instructor might have included.
                      When the same Random Seed is used, the same problem will be generated. This can be used to debug
                      problems if students see a version of the problem with an error and to check that variations of
                      the problem are correctly being generated and graded.

                      Click Create Problem and select Dynamic (Raw Lua).

                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">It should be noted that Templated problems and Raw Lua have practically
                      the same capabilities.
                      We expect that instructors will usually only use Raw Lua problems when they are building a very
                      complex problem where the structure of the problem instances might vary wildly so that they can't
                      write a single template.
                      Anything done in Raw Lua can generally be done in Templated problems, and this is the recommended
                      approach.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">There are four sections that require attention: Add Dependency,
                      Dependent Libraries, Number of Parts, and Code.
                      Both Add Dependency and Dependent Libraries function exactly as they do with Templated problems,
                      allowing Instructors to add any Lua libraries they have uploaded.
                      The Number of Parts is a function similar to the Add Part button in Templated problems.
                      If you wish for a multi-part problem, it must be manually specified by entering the amount of
                      parts in the field.
                      The Code section is where the problem is made using Lua Code.
                      The code, when run, should define the following: part_1_text, evaluate_answer_1, and
                      part_1_max_points.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">The <b>part_1_text</b> function takes no input and produces a string
                      which represents the HTML for the first problem.
                      If you have more than one part to this problem, you should also define similar functions call
                      part_2_text, part_3_text, etc.
                      The <b>evaluate_answer_1</b> function takes in a table which maps the names of the form inputs
                      from part 1 to values which are the answers provided for those form inputs by the user.
                      It returns a table which maps the names of the form inputs to a table containing two values:
                      “success”, which maps to a boolean indicating whether or not the answer was sufficient to continue
                      to the next part and "value", which maps to a floating point number indicating how many points
                      were awarded for that answer.
                      The <b>part_1_max_points</b> function takes no input, but returns a table which maps the name of
                      each input to the maximum possible number of points a student could earn for that problem.
                      An example of proper Raw Lua code is in the Code section when creating the problem.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">As with Template problems, Instructors can test their problems before

                      Instructors can create live discussion channels, have students post questions to different
                      channels to be answered during class, and create channels for different groups for group projects.

                  <span>
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">The OneUp platform includes a game engine which is responsible for
                      executing Rules defined by the instructor.
                      The Rules specify under what Conditions (based on challenges, activities and skills) specific game
                      elements will be applied.
                      The Rules have the format <i>IF condition THEN action </i>, for example, <i>IF a student completes
                        more than 20 challenges THEN award her a badge</i>.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">After a student's interaction with OneUp, the game engine checks the
                      rules to see if specific conditions are met.
                      If they are, then the corresponding actions specified by the Instructor occur.
                      These actions can vary: a Badge is awarded, Virtual Currency is awarded, a new Challenge is
                      unlocked, etc.
                      While sounding complex and intimidating, creating Rule Conditions can be simply thought of as
                      specifying a Boolean expression.</p>

                  <span>
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">If you are creating a Badge, setting Virtual Currency Earning Rules, or
                      configuring Progressive Unlocking, you will need to specify the Rule Conditions.
                      The Rule Conditions section is always found at the bottom of the page.
                      A simple Rule Condition (Atom Condition) consists of two parts, which will be compared.
                      For example, a Condition would read like this: <i>The percent of student score for Challenge X is
                        more than or equal to 75</i>. </p>
                        <br />
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">The Rule Conditions section is a drag-and-drop interface: drag a
                      condition type (Atom, OR, or Forall) into the dotted rectangle to begin modifying it.
                      Note the small <b>AND</b> followed by another dotted rectangle.
                      This is for when you want multiple conditions to be true in order for the rule to fire (i.e. x = 2
                      AND y = 3).
                      There are three condition types: <b>Atom, OR,</b> and <b>Forall.</b> </p>
                      <br />
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">The <b>Atom</b> condition is a single conditional statement (i.e. if (x
                      = 5) would only be true if x = 5).
                      Atom is the primary condition type, for they can apply to most situations.
                      By default, an Atom condition type is the first condition in the Rule Conditions section.
                      The Atom condition has three parameters: the Variable, the Operator, and the Threshold.
                      The Variable is the specific condition that is being checked (i.e. student percentage score on a
                      challenge).
                      The Operator can be one of five options: greater than (>), less than (<), equal to (=), greater
                        than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=). The operators function just as they do
                          mathematically. The Threshold simply specifies the value to which the Variable will be
                          compared. By default, the Threshold is a number, but if the Value checkbox is unchecked, the
                          Instructor can choose another variable to compare to the first. </p> <p
                          style="text-indent:40px">The <b>OR</b> condition specifies that when one of two or more
                          conditions are true then the entire condition would be true (i.e. the statement if (x < 2) OR
                            (x> 4) would be true if x = 1 or 5).
                            OR is useful if the Instructor desires multiple ways to satisfy a condition. </p>
                            <br />
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">The <b>Forall</b> condition allows Instructors to specify how broad the
                      rule is.
                      There are three selectors in Forall: For, Of the following, and Items to add.
                      The 'Of the following' selector allows the Instructor to select the objects to be considered for
                      the condition: Challenges, Activities, Topics, and Categories (Activity Categories).
                      The 'Items to add' selector allows the Instructor to add one or more items of the type specified
                      in the 'Of the following' selector.
                      The checkbox next to the 'Items to add' selector will select all of the items of the selected type
                      if checked (i.e All Activities).
                      The For selector simply specifies whether <b>each</b> or <b>all</b> of the specified selections
                      shall be considered.
                      At the bottom of the Forall condition is included a dotted rectangle.
                      You have to drag an Atom or OR condition there. The dragged Atom or OR condition will work just
                      the same, but with the added restrictions set by the Instructor.
                      Once an Atom condition is placed, the available variables in the drop-down menu become more
                      specific depending on the item type selected in the 'Of the following' selector.</p>
                      <br />
                    <p style="text-indent:40px">To remove a condition from the area, drag it to the <b>Trash</b> box at

                      <span>
                        <p style="text-indent:40px">Badges are a form of an award a student can receive for completing
                          tasks specified by the Instructor.
                          There are three types of Badges: Automatic, Manual, and Time-Period based.
                          Automatic Badges are awarded according to Rule Conditions defined by the Instructor.
                          Manual Badges are badges with no conditions that are assigned manually to individual students
                          by the instructor.
                          Time-Period Based Badges are automatically awarded at specific time intervals to students who
                          meet certain conditions (i.e. students with a 5-day attendance streak).
                          The main purpose of Badges is to give students a sense of achievement and progress as they
                          advance through the course.
                          Badges that students earn are shown in their Achievements page and the Latest Badges section
                          of the Course Home page.</p>

                          The Badge Image section allows the Instructor to pick the image for the badge from a
                          collection of available images.
                          The same badge image can be used for multiple badges.
                          The Award Frequency option specifies whether to award the badge just once, or once per
                          Challenge, Activity, Topic, or Category.
                          To define Rule Conditions for the Badge, follow the guidelines discussed in How do I create a

                          They allow the instructor to create Badges for cases in which it is not possible to define a
                          Rule Condition that can be automatically checked (for example, if there is no necessary

                            It should be noted that ONLY Manual Badges can be assigned to/removed from students

                          The primary difference here is the Time-Period conditions.
                          These are not unlike Rule Conditions, but much more streamlined to simplify the process. </p>
                        <p style="text-indent:40px"> There are four Condition options that require attention: Give To,

                          The <b>Give To</b> option allows Instructors to give the badge to either a number of top

                          The <b>Number of Students</b> option only appears if the Top # option is selected and sets the

                          The <b>Time Period</b> drop-down menu specifies how often the badge will be awarded to
                          students (i.e. Daily, Weekly, etc.).</br>
                          The <b>Condition</b> section functions much like a Rule Condition, but with fewer, more
                          specific options. </br>
                          The Operator and Threshold function the same as with Rule Conditions.

                      The primary purpose of this feature is to have students complete challenges/activities in a

                          to students for completing tasks and meeting specific conditions set by the Instructor.
                          The main purpose of Virtual Currency is to provide an incentive for students to complete
                          course work and routinely track their progress.
                          Virtual Currency can be spent on some course-related goods at the discretion of the
                          Instructor, such as Deadline Extensions, Assignment Re-submissions, Extra Credit, Lowest Grade
                          Replacement, and a great host of other benefits.
                          As with Badges, there are three different types of Virtual Currency Earning Rules: Automatic,
                          Manual, and Time-Period Based.
                          Manual earning rules are rules with no conditions.
                          Time-Period Based rules are awarded at specific time intervals to students who meet certain
                          conditions (i.e. students with a 5-day attendance streak).</p>

                          Here you can view/modify all Time-Period rules created so far and the amount of currency they
                          award.

                          The Rule Name, Rule Description, and Course Bucks Earned serve the same purposes as with
                          previous VC Earning Rules.
                          The primary difference here is the Time-Period conditions.
                          These are not unlike Rule Conditions, but much more streamlined to simplify the process. </p>
                        <p style="text-indent:40px"> There are four Condition options that require attention: Give To,
                          Number of Students, Time Period, and the Condition section.
                          The <b>Give To</b> option allows Instructors to give the VC to either a number of top students
                          (Top #), all students, or randomly.
                          The <b>Number of Students</b> option only appears if the Top # option is selected and sets the
                          number of students who will earn the VC.
                          The <b>Time Period</b> drop-down menu specifies how often the VC will be awarded to students
                          (i.e. Daily, Weekly, etc.).
                          The <b>Condition</b> section functions much like a Rule Condition, but with fewer, more
                          specific options.
                          The Operator and Threshold function the same as with Rule Conditions.
                          Once all parameters are set, click Create Rule to add the new Time-Period Rule to the Periodic

                          In the Game Features menu, hover over Virtual Currency and then select Spending Rules to go to

                          Click the Create Spending Rule button to be taken to the Spending Rule Creation page.
                          The Rule Name and Rule Description fields assign the rule a name and give a description of

                          The VC Amount option simply sets the price of the item while the Limit option sets how many
                          times the item can be purchased by the student (during the entire course).
                          Once a student purchases an item in the Course Shop, the Instructor gets a notification and

                          Dueling is entirely up to the students, with very little Instructor involvement in the

	This template include expects the following variables:
		q - a question dictionary structure as generated by the appropriate function in questionTypes or the dynamicQuestionPartAJAX view
		part - a number indicating which part of the question this is
		retry - a boolean indicating whether or not it's still possible for the student to resubmit
		failure (optional) - a structure the presence of which indicates that they failed one or more answer blanks.
			It should be a dictionary containing:
				numAnswerBlanksTotal - how many answer blanks there are total
				numAnswerBlanksIncorrect - how many answer blanks were incorrect
				pointsTotal - how many points were available for this part
				pointsEarned - how many they recieved
				pointsPossible - how many points they could earn if they retry
				pointsForFutureParts - how many points future parts are worth
				retriesRemaining - how many resubmissions they have available
		partial_success (optional) - a structure the presence of which indicates that they failed one or more answer blanks.

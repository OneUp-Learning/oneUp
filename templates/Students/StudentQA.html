      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">question_answer</i>What Are Parson's Problems and How Do I Solve Them?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Parsons problems are problems in which you have to order code "code lines" in a correct order.

You have to drag and drop the given "code blocks" onto the silver-grey box on the right. Please pay attention to indentation, as it may be graded.

<br><br>

When you press the "Get Feedback" button, each wrong line will be highlighted in red to indicate that the line is wrong.
If your order is considered correct the code will be highlighted in green.

Note that each time you press the "Get Feedback" button, if the code is incorrect this will halve the points. </span></div>

    <li>
      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">question_answer</i>How Is a Parson's Problem Graded?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Each time you press the "Get Feedback" button, if the code is incorrect this will halve the points. If the problem was correct, then you will receive full credit.<br><br>

If “Code Indentation” is set to “true” by the instructor, indentation errors in the your solutions are counted against you at the rate of  1 point deduction per N lines of code divided by half, i.e. (1/N)*(1/2).
<br><br>
Each "code line" or "code block" error is a deduction of (1/N).
Each "code line" or "code block" under or over the required number of correct lines is also a deduction of (1/N).</span></div>

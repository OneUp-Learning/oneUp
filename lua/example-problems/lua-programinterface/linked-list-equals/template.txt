Write a method equals() that checks to see if two lists are equal. Hint: Check to see if lists are equal in size; If the lists are unequal sizes, should be automatic false 

   /** Check to see if two lists are the same.  
    * @param aList another linked list to check this list against
    * @return true if all the items in this list and the other list are equals
    */ 

	public boolean equals(LList<T> aList){
	
	[{make_answer('ans1','code-java',12,checker,12)}]
	
	}

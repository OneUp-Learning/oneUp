The class LinkedQueue implements the interface QueueInterface by using a linked structure. The variables 'firstNode' and 'lastNode' are instance variables in this class of type Node; the first one references the node at the front of the queue and the second one - the node at the back of the queue.
In the class LinkedQueue write a method splice() in the LinkedQueue class that adds all items in queue2 to the end of the queue on which the method is applied.

	// The firstNode of the first chain will be the firstNode of the result
	// The lastNode of the second chain will be the last node of the result

	public LinkedQueue<T> splice(LinkedQueue<T> queue2) {

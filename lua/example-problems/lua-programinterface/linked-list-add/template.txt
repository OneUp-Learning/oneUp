Write a method add() that adds an element to a list in a certain position. You can use the method getNodeAt(int givenPosition) from the ListInterface, which returns the node in the list at the given position. 

	//Should make a case if the list is empty by adding the entry to first position
	//If not empty, should use nodeBefore and nodeAfter to place entry
	//Method should use getNodeAt(int givenPosition)
	
	public boolean add1(int newPosition, T newEntry){

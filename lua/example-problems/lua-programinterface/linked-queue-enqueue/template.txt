The class LinkedQueue implements the interface QueueInterface by using a linked structure. The variables 'firstNode' and 'lastNode' are instance variables in this class of type Node; the first one references the node at the front of the queue and the second one - the node at the back of the queue.
 In the class LinkedQueue write a method enqueue() that adds an element to the end of the queue.

  	//If the queue is empty, the firstNode should be the new element
  
	public void enqueue(T newEntry) {
